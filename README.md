# Password-Generator
This is a password generate app. When you click the generate password button, a prompt pops up and asks for how long you would like the password. Based on the number you pick it will then ask you if you'd like your password to include lower case, upper case, numbers, or symbols. Then you'll have the option to to copy the password to your clipboard. 

In JavaScript, I set variables with strings of what the characters can be. Then I created a function that when the button "generate password" is clicked the user is asked questions. Then, based on their answers to the questions, a string is created with the possible characters that are allowed.
